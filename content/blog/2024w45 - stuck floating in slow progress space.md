> [!Idea] Weekly updates (overviews/newsletter) linking out to detailed articles.

# Outline

- intro and health update
- using note cards for storyboarding on the go
- music tests in cakewalk
- leveraging physical enviroment to reward activity vs passive consumption (standing desk, walking and thinking)

- bit off too much. scaling back some shots / being more clever about storytelling
- next steps (temp voice, temp music, timeline)

- be less hard on yourself, allow time and room for exploration, look for ways to enjoy and reward. At least I have found that when I punish myself for not being focused enough, it creates pressure that when I sit down to work “it has to worth the time”, and that’s a mindset that breeds anxiety and discourages me from wanting to create anything. This will lead to burn out, I can tell. Instead I try to remind myself that to sit use my time for making something is worth it _already_.

# Intro:

It's been a few weeks since last update on my [[stuck floating animation project]], in part due to a minor bicycle–metal post–knee accident, and partly because I’ve been a busy bee.

Progress is slow but not zero. I’m making my way out of thumbnailingn stage and into a storyboard with temporary voice acting and a temporary score.

The current target is to have an animatic by the end of the year, but I’ve severely underestimated the scope and now that I’m placing things unto the timeline there is no way I can fit the story into a 2-minute animation. I hope it’s under 3-4 minutes.

I’ll need to try harder to cut down as much work as I can by making smarter choices in the storyboard stage.

# What I’ve been up to?

My [[Treat film like painting|last]] post mentions the idea of working on everything at once, to the same level of detail. This way there is more intermingling of ideas between “production departments”, it’s easier to make changes and you can stop almost at any point if you are happy with the piece.

So for the past month I’m trying out this philosophy, with my focus being on Storyboaring, beginnings of a Score and Voice Acting. I’m trying to get towards a arough animatic, and then will start refining.

## Storyboaring process

As I’d hurt my knee, it was physically painful to sit and difficult to find time to focus for a couple weeks. But what’s worked for me was using pocketable paper cards for storyboarding on the go.

These cards have been a good tool to make better use of my time during the daily commutes to my day job. And it's just a really fun exercise to capture ideas visually first. In recent years I’ve strayed away from sketching my ideas in preference of writing, so this exercise has been a good change of pace, and I want to incorporate it more seriously into my “tools for thought” arsenal.

## Score

I got my first piano a month ago, and have been practicing (not enough admittedly), and although the progress is not significant I’m getting more comfortable with navigating the notes.

For the score I’ve gone with Cakewalk, which turned out to be a gem in the rough. There are points of it that feel clunky but it works for me. I’ve made a lot of little tests and melodies to try and I’m slowly feeling my way towards my vision. There is no solid vision yet, just fragmented snippets I’m trying to connect, but it's getting clearer.

# Nexf Steps

In the future, it would be nice to make these posts more frequent, so I aim for weekly update posts, and 1-2 sepcific mini-essays as a bonus. This feels like a good compromise between structure and freedom.
